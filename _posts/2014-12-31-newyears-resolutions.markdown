This year I have 2 newyear's resolutions:

1. Maintaining this blog with at least one new article per month, but a weekly pace would be better. I will do that using [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Atom][atom].
2. Learning to type with 10 fingers... I never learned how to do this but am very jealous on people that can. I will do that using [Type Fu][type-fu] and/or [QuickQWERTY][quickqwerty].

[type-fu]:     http://type-fu.com/
[quickqwerty]: http://quickqwerty.com/
[jekyll]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll
[atom]:        https://atom.io/
